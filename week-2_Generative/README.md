## P5.JS

A p5.js sketch is made from a few different languages used together. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the backbone, linking all the other elements together in a page. JavaScript (and the p5.js library) enable you to create interactive graphics that display on your HTML page. Sometimes CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to further style elements on the HTML page, but we wonâ€™t cover that yet.
