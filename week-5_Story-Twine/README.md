## Public Events This Week

**Saturday (09/30) 1-5pm, Dolphin Gallery:** Fall Arcade
Our annual showcase of student games is this Saturday. There are some really wonderful tabletop, digital, and VR games this year (a little something for everyone!) It's open to the public, so have your students come and invite some friends.

**Tuesday (10/03) 7pm, Dolphin 2F: Bonnie Crawford**:
A Baltimore-based artist named Bonnie Crawford will be doing a class visit with Robotic Arts Intro and giving a public talk at 7pm out in the main lab on the 2nd floor of Dolphin. Her work is very tactile, mixing drawings, found objects, and hand sewn pieces with freeform electronics. Really good stuff.

There's an international speaker visiting MICA named Xu Bing at 4pm that same day! Try to make both if you can!
