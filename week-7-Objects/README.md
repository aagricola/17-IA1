## Hello!

I apologize, but due to sickness, we will not have class today.

I would still like for you to learn though, so I have put together some examples using various dom elements that you have either asked about or that I think you will find useful.

I also want for you to try to follow the Daniel Shiffman video about objects and, like he says, try to take one of your sketches and organize its parts into a class.

## What are Objects!?!?

- Objects are a way to group variables with related functions.
- They break up your ideas into building blocks -- mimicking the natural world (organs, tissues, cells)
- They make it easier to write smaller pieces to make up a more complicated structure

In the context of objects, a variable is called a **property** (or instance variable)
A function is called a **method**. The idea is to group related data (properties) with related methods that act on that data.

### Common Analogies:
- A cookie cutter is the object constructor
  the cookie is the object instance
- The blueprint for a house is the object constructor
  the house is an object instance
- The object constructor is the template
  the object is the thing itself

**Objects are collections of values and functions**

What goes in the constructor is up to you - depends on what you're making
First think about what properties and methods your object will have.
- Keep in mind that one reason to make an object is to group together
related data elements. For your methods, select clear names to help yourself stay organized.
Remember, the methods are used to change the values of the properties and to perform actions based on the properties’ values.

[Getting Started with p5.js](http://people.uncw.edu/tompkinsj/112/JavaScript/GettingStartedwithP5js.pdf) has an entire chapter on objects that is very useful to read through and it's where the above information is sourced from!

[Hackers is Playing Tonight at the Parkway](https://mdfilmfest.com/film/gunkys-basement-hackers/), 9pm, presented by Dan Deacon and Jimmy Joe Roche!!!! This is an event not to be missed. Sadly I will be home in bed with tea, tissues and cough drops, but I hope that you all go if you have $10 (maybe $8 with MICA i.d. but not 100% sure) to spare.

"HACK THE PLANET! Jonny Lee Miller, Angelina Jolie, and Matthew Lillard star as high-school hackers caught up in international intrigue in this, arguably the most ‘90s films the ‘90s produced. Penn Jillette (Penn & Teller), Lorraine Bracco (Goodfellas, The Sopranos), and Wendell Pierce (The Wire) co-star. “[T]his engaging and lively exploitation fantasy-thriller about computer hackers, anarchistic in spirit, succeeds at just about everything The Net failed to.”—Jonathan Rosenbaum, Chicago Reader"

## Project 2: System
Using p5.js, design a system that has many (maybe even infinite) number of outcomes. It can be a game, drawing generator, non-linear story, or anything you can dream up. Do something personally exciting to you.

## Homework

- Watch the videos about objects! Try using a class to organize one of your existing sketches. If you don't quite understand, don't worry. We can review this next week.
- Follow along in this weeks examples of using dom elements. Be sure to read my comments.
- Make a sketch using a p5 core library. (i.e. dom or sound) (if you want to use any other you find interesting on the reference page, you can, just make sure you include it in the head of your index.html)
- Come to class with your project proposal and be ready for your work day.
