## Repetition

Repetition is a huge part of the language of computing. We see patterns in graphic design, in nature, in music, and pretty much everywhere we look.

["Here to There"](http://zanyparade.com/v8/projects.php?id=17), Emily Gobeille and Theodore Watson, 2008
This is from a series of large format posters for children that combine science, nature, algorithm and design, to feed their imagination and curiosity. You can see a balance of hand illustration and generated pattern in these. They developed a suite of software tools using openFrameworks to programmatically build elements of visual stories being told.

"When I started using computers in 1980, very few artists were using them. To me, these machines were totally cool and exciting. Back then there was little software of interest to an artist like myself. To make art with computers, you had to invent new working procedures. I bought a personal computer and learned to write my own software. I was trying to find a unique way of using the computer and software to create geometric images." -Mark Wilson

"13/9/65 Nr. 2 ("Hommage à Paul Klee")", Frieder Nake, 1965

Nake lists the random elements of this work. They are:
- Change of original width of the horizontal bands (at the left boundary)
- The “buckling” of the horizontal bands as they extend from left to right, but so that they never intersect
- For each quadrilateral that is generated as part of one horizontal band, a random decision is made: it is left empty, or filled by vertical lines, or by triangles
- The number of signs per quadrilateral (vertical lines or triangles)
- Positions of those signs per quadrilateral
- Additionally, the number of circles
- Position of each circle
- Size (radius) of the circles Size: 50 × 50 cm
- Signed lower left: Nake/ER56/Z64 (automaticly drawn signature)

This iconic generative pattern was created in response to Klee's "Hauptweg und Nebenwege"

## Repeat Loops

- comes in handy when you want to use a few lines of code to do something over and over and over
control structure of an if.
- these are great if you want to generate patterns
- good for creating gridded games
- also used in image processing

## Public Events This Week

**Saturday (09/30) 1-5pm, Dolphin Gallery:** Fall Arcade
Our annual showcase of student games is this Saturday. There are some really wonderful tabletop, digital, and VR games this year (a little something for everyone!) It's open to the public, so have your students come and invite some friends.

**Tuesday (10/03) 7pm, Dolphin 2F: Bonnie Crawford**:
A Baltimore-based artist named Bonnie Crawford will be doing a class visit with Robotic Arts Intro and giving a public talk at 7pm out in the main lab on the 2nd floor of Dolphin. Her work is very tactile, mixing drawings, found objects, and hand sewn pieces with freeform electronics. Really good stuff.

There's an international speaker visiting MICA named Xu Bing at 4pm that same day! Try to make both if you can!

## Homework

- By tomorrow: Upload 5 imgaes, a .gif, or video of your Project 1 along with source code. Include your name in the file name.  (Quciktime offers easy screen record capabilities. Let me know if you do not know how to do this and I can show you.)
- Read the "Repeat" & "Parameters" chapter from _Form & Code_
- Create a visual pattern using for loops. It can be of your own design, or if you are having trouble thinking of something, make a "Master Copy" of one of the algorist's computer generated patterns.
