["Mécaniques Discursives](https://vimeo.com/153668027), by Fred Penelle & Legoman, at biennale némo 2015

"By contrasting the oldest form of image reproduction (woodcutting) with the most recent digital technologies, the installation straddles centuries and contracts time.”

["In Order to Control"](http://www.notabenevisual.com/#/works/in-order-to-control/), by NOTA BENE (multi-disciplinary studio based in Istanbul, specialized in digital experiences with the newest technology for global brands & artistic platforms by focussing on video projection mapping, interactive experiences and installations.)

"As viewers access the space and their shadows cover the words on the floor, which were then projected on the wall instead. In order to make sense of the text, the viewer has to move and possibly to join arms with other viewers.
They designed the installation in a way that calls for the viewer’s complete engagement of body and mind. In fact, the ethical question behind the work addresses our capacities to ‘move’ and take action in our controversial society."
