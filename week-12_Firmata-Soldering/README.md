# Hello!

## Today:

- Homeworks
- Arduino to Processing using Firmata
- Soldering
- Syphon to Mad Mapper
- Bare Touch Demo
- Get with your partner(s)
  - brainstorm / write a proposal

## Project 3: Collaborative Machine

Make a project with a partner or a group that conceptualizes the idea of the self as a machine. Create a physical interface that can be used by the viewer to interact. Can you make something that engages with human experience through the lens of the machine? Or what about a human, machine integration that could make people more human, more mindful, or more empathetic?

The following are the deliverables for the project:

- Interactive work of art using Arduino and p5.js
- Artist statement about the work
- Good documentation of the Piece
- Peer review

## Creative Interface

"Millions of crowdworkers are helping the digital world run smoothly by solving the problems that computers can’t solve just yet. Among many other tasks they categorize images, transcribe texts and filter out explicit content. Ironically, by doing so they also train the algorithms which will replace them eventually.

How would everyday life be affected if this digital piecework was woven into it? The Bachelor thesis project Human Element Inc. explores this question through three speculative crowdwork services."

 Incontroller is a game designed where the difficulty level in the game increases in the controller while the software remains the same.

 ## Projection Mapping Workshop

 "By contrasting the oldest form of image reproduction (woodcutting) with the most recent digital technologies, the installation straddles centuries and contracts time.”

["In Order to Control"](http://www.notabenevisual.com/#/works/in-order-to-control/), by NOTA BENE (multi-disciplinary studio based in Istanbul, specialized in digital experiences with the newest technology for global brands & artistic platforms by focussing on video projection mapping, interactive experiences and installations.)

"As viewers access the space and their shadows cover the words on the floor, which were then projected on the wall instead. In order to make sense of the text, the viewer has to move and possibly to join arms with other viewers.
They designed the installation in a way that calls for the viewer’s complete engagement of body and mind. In fact, the ethical question behind the work addresses our capacities to ‘move’ and take action in our controversial society."
