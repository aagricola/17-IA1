# Hello!

## Today:

- Homeworks
- Arduino to Processing using Firmata
- Soldering
- Get with your partner(s)
  - brainstorm / write a proposal

## Project 3: Collaborative Machine

Make a project with a partner or a group that conceptualizes the idea of the self as a machine. Create a physical interface that can be used by the viewer to interact. Can you make something that engages with human experience through the lens of the machine? Or what about a human, machine integration that could make people more human, more mindful, or more empathetic?

The following are the deliverables for the project:

- Interactive work of art using Arduino and p5.js
- Artist statement about the work
- Good documentation of the Piece
- Peer review

## Creative Interface

"Millions of crowdworkers are helping the digital world run smoothly by solving the problems that computers canâ€™t solve just yet. Among many other tasks they categorize images, transcribe texts and filter out explicit content. Ironically, by doing so they also train the algorithms which will replace them eventually.

How would everyday life be affected if this digital piecework was woven into it? The Bachelor thesis project Human Element Inc. explores this question through three speculative crowdwork services."

 Incontroller is a game designed where the difficulty level in the game increases in the controller while the software remains the same.
