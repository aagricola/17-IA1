MICA Interactive Arts 1: Creative Coding

## Course Description
An introduction to the concepts and practices of IDA, integrating new media art, games, and systems thinking. Students will be introduced to the relevant technologies, histories, and materials of integrated digital art making. Students will create several projects over the semester, as well as developing a context for their work via lectures, presentations, & critiques.

## Course Goals
The goal of this course is to become familiar with tools and processes used in the production of interactive digital art and design. Through examples and discussion, students will gain an understanding of the context in which their own interactive projects exist.

## Important Things to Remember
- Help is always a click away; via the internet, your peers, or emailing me. Remember to do homework ahead of time so that you can get questions to me 48 hours before class.
- Mistakes are great ways to learn. Be courageous, fail flamboyantly, and know that you tried your best. Don't let fear or mistakes stand in your way of learning and creating.
- Participation and collaboration are integral parts of this class's culture.

- You get one unexcused absence, the next diminished your grade and three gets an F. Please provide me with a doctors note if you are sick.
