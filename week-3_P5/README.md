# Hello!
## Today:
- Look at homeworks
  - Please submit an image and the source code with your last name in the file name.
- Get started with P5.js -> convert a sketch
- Download Atom and install packages
- Elaborate on conditional logic
- Discuss "Tech's Moral Reckoning"
- Work on assignment

## P5.JS

A p5.js sketch is made from a few different languages used together. HTML (HyperText Markup Language) provides the backbone, linking all the other elements together in a page. JavaScript (and the p5.js library) enable you to create interactive graphics that display on your HTML page. Sometimes CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used to further style elements on the HTML page, but we won’t cover that yet.
- [Here is the official website](https://p5js.org/)
- [Converting Processing sketch to P5](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Processing-transition)
- [Here is the online editor](http://alpha.editor.p5js.org/). Use at your own risk.
- [Let's go ahead and download Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Atom (or any code editor)

Allows you to edit any code, and install helpful packages.

install packages:
- p5xjs-autocomplete
- platformio-ide-terminal
- prettier
- Explore and install any other packages that seem useful to you on your own time.

## Terminal

We use the terminal to serve the sketches to our local host. Follow these steps:

- Drag the whole folder where your sketch.js file lives to Atom (make sure your libraries and assets are inside this folder)
- Open your terminal in your sketch in Atom
- Enter (You may need to enter your password if your computer is password protected)
- Copy this: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
- enter
- In your browser, go to localhost:8000 and you should see your sketch running
- Whenever you save updates to the code, you can refresh and see changes on the localhost
- To close the terminal when you are finished, hit ctl + c

## Non-linear Story

“Access to computers and the Internet completely changed the way that I consumed information and organized ideas in my head. I saw information stacked on top of itself in simultaneity, no longer confined to spatiotemporal dimensions of the book.”  – Krystal South , quote from idyrslf.com

Zork is one of the earliest interactive fiction computer games, with roots drawn from the original genre game, Colossal Cave Adventure. The first version of Zork was written between 1977 and 1979. The authors—Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling—were members of the MIT Dynamic Modelling Group.

olia lialina,_ my boyfriend came back from the war_ (m.b.c.b.f.t.w.)

It tells the story of two lovers who reunite after an unspecified conflict. Fragments of dialogue convey the difficulty they have reconnecting, though not explicitly stated. She approaches the web as a medium similar to film. She calls it a netfilm. The flow splits and digresses into multiple threads, similar to a cinematic montage in which separate simultaneous actions are edited to produce the effect of simultaneity.

Based in Seoul, South Korea,Young-hae Chang Heavy Industries, composed of the Korean Young-hae Chang and the American Marc Voge, combine text with jazz music with Flash productions in which they use solely the Monaco font. In these works they are breaking the Internet tendency to emphasize interactivity and foregrounding photo’s, illustrations and excessive use of colors.

Shu Lea Cheang, "Brandon", bigdoll interface,
 collaboration with Jordy Jones and Cherise Fong, 1998

 Teena Brandon, 21 year old woman who was raped an killed for passing as a man  (movie “Boys Don't Cry” was based on this)
Guggenheim Museum commissioned Taiwanese-American artist to explore Teena’s story in a non-linear, experimental way.

 ## Project 1: Non-linear story
 Using the skills we have learned in class so far, create a Non-linear story about an experience you have had.

 ## Resources
 - [Twine](https://twinery.org/) could be useful in writing your non-linear story
 - [Nicky Case](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zl9m0AQInBk)'s talk on explorable explanations is good inspiration for the assignment
 - If you don't like Atom, download the [P5 editor](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-editor/releases)
 - [Daniel Shiffman tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8j0UDiN7my4&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA)

## homework

- Start on your non-linear story by story-boarding, create wireframe, use twine and/or p5.js 
- Post to our discussion board on Canvas responding to last weeks On Being podcast
