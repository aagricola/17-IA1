# Hello!

## Today
- Look at pattern assignments
- Post-Internet Art Presentation by Caleb
- Review Objects
- Work on Projects

## Why Use Objects
- Objects are a way to group variables with related functions.
- They break up your ideas into building blocks
- They make it easier to write smaller pieces to make up a more complicated structure
- The idea is to group related data (properties) with related methods that act on that data.

In the context of objects, a variable is called a **property** (or instance variable)
A function is called a **method**.

**Objects are collections of values and functions**

## Project 2: System
Using p5.js, design a system that has many (maybe even infinite) number of outcomes. It can be a game, drawing generator, non-linear story, or anything you can dream up. Do something personally exciting to you. Also, consider the end product and presentation of the project.

Think about social systems, cultural algorithms, and codes that are at work on a micro and macro scale. Design your own system that addresses your relationship to these.

"With Connections No.5, I worked with the principles of “body and physicalness, movement, play, lightness, empty space and curiousity.”

## Resources
[Interesting article on the addictive nature of technology](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/oct/05/smartphone-addiction-silicon-valley-dystopia)

[Getting Started with p5.js](http://people.uncw.edu/tompkinsj/112/JavaScript/GettingStartedwithP5js.pdf) has an entire chapter on objects that is very useful to read through and it's from where my examples are derived!

[Examples on Mouse Interactions with Objects](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaN5At5RWH8&index=26&list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6Zy51Q-x9tMWIv9cueOFTFA) This video and the following videos, 7.4-7.7, pick up where we leave off and offer more ways to interact with objects if you desire.  

## Homework

- Order [Arduino Uno](https://www.adafruit.com/product/50) and [A-B USB](https://www.adafruit.com/product/62)
- Finish systems project for next class.
- Print Sherry Turkle reading from the resources folder --> Read. We will discuss it on **Nov. 1**
